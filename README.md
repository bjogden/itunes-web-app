# itunes-web-app

*Disclaimer: created this several years ago when first learning Python in college*

Using Python 3.3, parses iTunes RSS and displays data (based on HTML form submission) to user including song name, song preview, iTunes link to song, and link to YouTube. Currently looking for viable host, as this was initially hosted through my alma mater.
